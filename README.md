## Project Description

This was one of my first touch with NestJS back in September 2022. I got to know the basics of the framework, such as modules, services, controllers, I learned how to use TypeORM, Serialization and Dependency Injection. I also made a session based authentication. This project was a great first step to learn and to fresh up my NodeJS knowledge.
